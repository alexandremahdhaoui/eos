# eos

`eos` stands for Example OS.

## What is eos?

### Goals

Simplicity: a 5-years old should be able to understand what's going on.

### Non-goals

Fancy feature complete operating system.

## Why `eos`?

I'm curious & that sounds fun.

## How to achieve the goals?

- Lots of comments: should cover why, how, when and what.
- Everything is unit tested.
- Only 64 bit arch (aarch64 & amd64).
- Use "modern" languages: Go & Rust.
